            Diabetes doesn&apos;t have to be a life sentence. Our patients have
            reduced their HbA1c from 9.2 to 6.5 in under three months — with
            less medication, not more. We focus on what actually works:
            personalised diet plans, structured exercise, and continuous
            monitoring that puts you in control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Premlal&apos;s CCEBDM certification (Public Health Foundation of
            India &amp; Dr. Mohan&apos;s Diabetes Education Academy) means your
            treatment is grounded in the latest clinical evidence — not
            guesswork. Every plan is built around your body, your lifestyle, and
            your goals.
