          <p>
            If you or a loved one has been told that amputation is the only
            option, please get a second opinion first. Our CMC-accredited
            (Christian Medical College) diabetic foot care program has helped
            patients heal wounds that were considered untreatable — saving limbs
            and restoring the ability to walk, work, and live independently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using advanced wound management techniques, customised diabetic
            footwear, and a step-by-step healing protocol, we treat the wound
            and the underlying condition together. Every patient&apos;s recovery
            plan is closely monitored until full healing.
